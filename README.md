# Crypto-Wallet Java Application

This is a Spring Boot application built with Maven. This guide explains how to run the application from the command line.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 (check with `java -version`)
- Maven 3.6+ (check with `mvn -version`)

---

## üöÄ Building and Running the Application

The simplest way to run the application is to use Maven. Navigate to the main folder of the project and run the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

After that, you can request the following endpoints using curl or Postman:

## üåê API Endpoints

}
```
- **Response**: 200 OK

## üìù Considerations

- The application uses an in-memory database `(H2)` for simplicity. In a production environment, we should consider using a persistent database.
- The application is built with Spring Boot
- Swagger could be used to better document the API, but due to time constraints, it was not implemented.
- The application is designed to be simple and straightforward, focusing on the core functionality of managing a crypto wallet.
- Ideally the JPA relationships should use `Fetch type Lazy` to avoid loading all the data at once, and then combined with `CriteriaApi/Specifications`
or similar, but for simplicity, `Eager fetching` is used in this implementation.
- Some tests are included, but not all possible scenarios are covered. This is due to time constraints.
- In `CoinCapFeignConfig` we use an interceptor to include the `apiKey` in the header of the request to CoinCap API
- In `TokenFetchConfig` we use the properties `app.token-fetch.interval-seconds`and `app.token-fetch.max-threads-number` to configure the frequency 
of the tokens price update and the maximum number of threads to use for the update. This values can be edited in the `application.properties` file.
- In the current configuration, we use an `ExecutorService` with 3 threads to fetch and update token prices concurrently. This can be adjusted.
- Read-Write Lock: The use of a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` ensures that read operations can happen concurrently, while write operations (updating prices) are serialized.
- When fetching price history from CoinCap API, the interval h12 was chosen after some investigation, as it
provides a good balance between granularity and efficiency, which is helpful for those analyzing cryptocurrency assets over time but not necessarily at the minute level.
